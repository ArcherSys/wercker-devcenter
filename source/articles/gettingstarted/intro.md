# Getting Started with wercker

This guide will walk you through your first project with wercker and showcase the primary features wercker has to offer.

Before we start with developing our first application, make sure you have registered for a [wercker account](https://app.wercker.com/users/new) and installed the [command line interface](/articles/cli/intro.html).

Now, you are ready to start developing your first application with wercker. For your convenience we have created four separate Getting Started guides in Ruby, Python, Node.js and Go.
