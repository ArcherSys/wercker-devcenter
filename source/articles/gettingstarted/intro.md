# Getting Started with wercker

This guide will walk you through your first project with wercker and showcase the primary features wercker has to offer.

Before we start with developing our first application, make sure you have registered for a [wercker account](https://app.wercker.com/users/new) and installed the [command line interface](/articles/cli/intro.html).

Now, you are ready to get started with wercker. For your convenience we have created four separate Getting Started repositories in
[Ruby](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-ruby), [Python](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-python), [Node.js](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-nodejs) and [Go](https://github.com/wercker/getting-started-golang).

### Step 1. Fork the Repository

The first step is to fork one of the above mentioned repositories and clone it to your local machine.

### Step 2. Add Project

Next you can add this application to wercker. Log into wercker and push the `add application` button.

### Step 3. Code and create your first Build

Make a modification to the application's code. A simple update to the `README.md` will suffice but you can also create new functionality.

### Step 4. Deploy

You are now ready to deploy this application to the Cloud. For this guide we will walk you through a deploy on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) a popular platform-as-a-service provider.
