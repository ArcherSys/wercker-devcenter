# Introduction to wercker

Wercker is a continuous delivery platform that allows developers to test and deploy their code often. By embracing continuous delivery, developers reduce risk and eliminate waste while developing software.

In this chapter we will discuss the benefits of using wercker but also introduce you to the [concepts](/articles/introduction/concepts.html) and principles of wercker and continuous delivery.

You can also check out the different flows for the [Build](/articles/introduction/build.html), [Deployment](/articles/introduction/deployment.html) and [Provisioning](/articles/introduction/provisioning.html) processes.

After this chapter it is a good idea to install the wercker command and familiarize yourself with the [wercker.json](/articles/werckerjson/intro.html) file.
