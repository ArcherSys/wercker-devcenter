# Benefits of using wercker

By leveraging wercker for your continuous delivery process you gain several benefits, not only for yourself as a developer but also for the team you might operate.

## In the Cloud

We want you to focus on your code and the application that you are building and not on tedious install processes. Wercker is hosted in the cloud, so there is no need to download any software or buy your own hardware. In fact it takes under a minute to set up your project and use wercker.

## Integrated

Wercker integrates with your favorite developer platforms out there such as GitHub and Bitbucket for your version control. When you are ready to [deploy](/articles/deployment/intro.html) your application, we allow you to do so to cloud platforms like [Heroku](/articles/deployment/heroku.html) and Amazon Web Services.

## Social

Software is better developed together and thus wercker incorporates several social features such as an activity feed that showcases who in your team broke the build or deployed to which environment.
You are able to invite collaborators to your projects thus improving cooperation, all leading to better code.

## Languages and Services

The current version of Wercker offers support for Node.js, Python, Ruby and Go but we're working hard on adding other languages.
wercker also allows you to test your code and interact with popular services such as Redis and MongoDB but also RabbitMQ and of course MySQL and Postgres.

## Guidance

Throughout wercker, nudges and tips help you get the most out of wercker and aid you in keeping your code green.
This devcenter is the place where you can get up to speed on specific programming languages, services and concepts around continuous delivery.
