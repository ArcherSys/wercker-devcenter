# Deployment

This section describes the different deployment possiblities within wercker.

Wercker allows you to deploy your application to various [Platform-as-a-Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) providers such as Heroku ([see example](/articles/deployment/heroku.html)), OpenShift ([see example](/articles/deployment/openshift)) and CloudFoundry ([see example](/articles/deployment/cloudfoundry)) but also Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers including Amazon Web Services and Rackspace.

Furthermore you can use any mechanism to orchestrate and streamline your deploys through libraries such as [Fabric](http://fabfile.org), [Capistrano](https://github.com/capistrano/capistrano/wiki) or even plain old [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripting.

It is also possible to 'deploy' your code to package platforms such as [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org) that hosts libraries and other types of dependencies for your code, of which we will showcase an [example](/articles/deployment/pypi.html) as well.
